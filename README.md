# Programming_Plagiarism_Checker

This project is an extension of Greedy-String-Tiling matching algorithm to check the code blocks which are shufï¬‚ed independentedly. It is able to detect transposed subsequences, and is less perturbed by spurious additional statements. Additionally , n-grams model for n=2 and n=3 is also being used for this purpose.A bigram or digram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words similarly a trigram is sequnce of three adjacent letters. A bigram is an n-gram for n=2 and a trigram is for n=3.
